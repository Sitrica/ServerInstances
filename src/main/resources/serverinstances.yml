    # You can add some command arguments here for the server run command.
    # The default argument "-DIReallyKnowWhatIAmDoingISwear" allows the server to start up without the outdated delay message.
    # If you're using PaperSpigot you can add the argument "-Dcom.mojang.eula.agree=true" to allow for the eula to be signed as true.
    # This argument is great if you're generating servers, otherwise the eula from the server directory will be used like normal.
